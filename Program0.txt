; CSCI 6461 - Program 0
; This program loads a value from memory, stores it in a new location,
; and demonstrates the use of LDR, LDX, and STR.

    LOC 6             ; Start executable code at address 6 (safely after reserved area)


START:
LDR 0,0,VAL_A     ; Load GPR0 with the value at label VAL_A (which is 10)
LDX 1,STORE_LOC   ; CORRECTED: Load IXR1 with the address of label STORE_LOC
STR 0,1,0         ; Store GPR0's value (10) into the address held by IXR1
HLT               ; Halt the machine

; --- Data Section ---
; Place data safely after the HLT instruction so it's not executed.
VAL_A:      DATA 10
STORE_LOC:  DATA 0      ; The result (10) will be stored here by the program
